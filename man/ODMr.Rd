\title{ODMr: A package for working with the CUAHSI ODM}
\description{
The aim of this package is to provide some functions for retrieving and
loading data into an instance of a MS-SQL CUAHSI ODM database. In order to
make use of these functions a valid ODBC connection for the target database
needs to be defined.
}
\section{ODMr functions}{
 ODMselect can be used to retrieve data from an ODM
  database. ODMSelect returns a dataframe containing the required columns
  for working with ODM data.

  ODMload can be used to get data into an ODM database. ODMload takes an
  dataframe containing the required columns for working with ODM data and loads
  it. The dataframe will usually have been acquired using ODMselect or created
  using odm_data.
